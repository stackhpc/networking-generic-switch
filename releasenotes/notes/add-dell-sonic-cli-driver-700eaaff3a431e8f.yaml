    Adds Dell Enterprise SONiC CLI driver. This differs from the existing Dell
    SONiC driver in that it uses the `sonic-cli` to administer the switch.
    This ensures that the port names advertised via LLDP from the switch can
    be used without conversion to the different naming scheme used in the
    Linux userspace environment.
